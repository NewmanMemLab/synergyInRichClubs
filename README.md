# synergyInRichClubs

This repository contains MATLAB code used to perform the core analyses of synergy in the rich club (Faber et al., 2018). Several of the functions in this repository require inputs that were generated from external software; namely, the Transfer Entropy networks and synergy values. These were obtained via Nick Timme's Neuroscience Information Theory Toolbox (https://github.com/nmtimme/Neuroscience-Information-Theory-Toolbox).
